Few File Folder Commands:
	ls
		Lists all the elements present in the present directory
		
	ls -al
		Lists all the elements present along with the hidden files in the present directory along with the permissions granted to the files and folders
		
	pwd
		To show the present working directory
		
	mkdir [name of the folder]
		To create a new folder with the name specified
	
	touch [name of the file]
		To create a file with type and name of the file
		
	nano [file_name]
		Opens Nano editor to write something in the file
		
	gedit [file_name]
		Opens Gedit editor to write something in the file (Only for GNOME Desktop Envs)
	
	cat [file_name]
		Reads out the entire file on the terminal window
		
	mousepad [file_name]
		Opens Mousepad editor to write something in the file (Only for XFCE Desktop Envs)
				
	cp [options] source destination
		To copy a file to either to the same folder or to some other directory either with the same name 
		
	mv [options] source destination
		If the Destination is specified then the file with be moved from the pwd to the target location

	rm [file_name]
		Deletes the file
	
	rm -r [folder_name]
		Deletes the folder

	locate [filename]
		Shows the directory of the file

	grep [word][filename]

	sudo rm -r [folder_name]
		Deletes the hidden folder or any folder with certain priviledges
	
	chmod [OPTION]...[MODE,]MODE ... FILE...
		Changes file mode bits
		eg:
			if the pwd is Documents
			a new file 'New.txt' is created and a new directory A is created
			type ls -al to check the permissions assigned to them
			In all probabilites it will be like this:
			
			   drwxr-xr-x  [] [username] [username] [] [Date Time] A
				Here d means directory
				rwx are the priviledges given to the user (Read Write Execute)
				r-x are the priviledges given to the group (Read Execute)
				r-x are the priviledges given to others (Read Execute)

			   -rw-r--r--  [] [username] [username] [] [Date Time] New.txt
				Here _ at the beginning means that it is a file
				rw are the priviledges given to the user (Read Write)
				r-- are the priviledges given to the group (Read)
				r-- are the priviledges given to others (Read)
			
		Now if the priviledge is to be changed for either User or Group or Others then:
		
		~ chmod u=rwx New.txt
		~ ls -al
		drwxr-xr-x  [] [username] [username] [] [Date Time] A
	        -rwxr--r--  [] [username] [username] [] [Date Time] New.txt  [Now for user the mode is Read Write Execute]
	        
	        [+] For groups use g instead of u
	        [+] For groups use g instead of o
