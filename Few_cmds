			type ls -al to check the permissions assigned to them
			In all probabilites it will be like this:
			
			   drwxr-xr-x  [] [username] [username] [] [Date Time] A
				Here d means directory
				rwx are the priviledges given to the user (Read Write Execute)
				r-x are the priviledges given to the group (Read Execute)
				r-x are the priviledges given to others (Read Execute)

			   -rw-r--r--  [] [username] [username] [] [Date Time] New.txt
				Here _ at the beginning means that it is a file
				rw are the priviledges given to the user (Read Write)
				r-- are the priviledges given to the group (Read)
				r-- are the priviledges given to others (Read)
			
		Now if the priviledge is to be changed for either User or Group or Others then:
		
		~ chmod u=rwx New.txt
		~ ls -al
		drwxr-xr-x  [] [username] [username] [] [Date Time] A
	        -rwxr--r--  [] [username] [username] [] [Date Time] New.txt  [Now for user the mode is Read Write Execute]
	        
	        [+] For groups use g instead of u
